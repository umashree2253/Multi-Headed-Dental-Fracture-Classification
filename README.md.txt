# Multi-Headed Deep Learning for Dental Fracture Classification

##  Project Overview
This project implements a multi-headed deep learning model to classify dental fractures from OPG X-ray images. The model is developed and executed using Google Colab with GPU support.

## Model Details
- Custom multi-headed CNN architecture
- Designed to detect subtle dental fracture patterns

## Dataset
- Dental OPG X-ray images
- Classes include dental fractures and related conditions
- Only sample images are included

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

##  Results
- Model performance evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Visual performance plots are included in the repository

##  How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab  
2. Enable GPU (Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU)  
3. Run all cells sequentially
